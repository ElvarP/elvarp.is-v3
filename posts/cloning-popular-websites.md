So basically i ran into some Medium article that said that these websites are the best for practicing your frontend skills, so this is my attempt at cloning these websites. I used Tailwind.css for the styling, small amount of Javascript code (Mostly for the mobile menus) and Vite.js for the dev server. Some of the readme files or titles may be wrong, simply because i copy pasted them and cant be arsed to fix them.

## 1. Netflix.com clone

You can either view the source [here](https://github.com/ElvarP/netflix-clone) or preview the site [here](https://elvarp.github.io/netflix-clone).

Most of the functionality is enabled here, if you hover over some of the icons.

Also used [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) for this one.
